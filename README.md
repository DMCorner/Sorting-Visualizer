# Sorting Visualizer Site
A website I've built to show Merge, Heap, Quick and Bubble sort work on a randomised array of length 100, constructed with create-react-app.

# Lessons Learned
My first React project, while difficult to learn the basics of react while implementing the algorithms I enjoyed the challenge.

I needed to learn a lot about how the virtual DOM works and how to properly update it. As a side I also learned about big O notation though I'm unsure about how relevant that is within fron end development.

# Potential Future Features
1) A slider that varies the time between the steps of the sorting algorithm. Bubble sort takes a bit too long while quick sort is too fast to really see how it works.

2) 

Adding an API key to the Google Maps section to remove the "dev only" overlay

Deployment
Deployed with github pages.

Get started
From your command line, first clone this repo:

# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/rgneville/material-ui-site

# Go into the repository
$ cd material-ui-site

# Remove current origin repository
$ git remote remove origin
Then you can install the dependencies using NPM:

Using NPM:

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Start development server
$ npm start
You should now have a development server running in your default browser.

yarn build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.
